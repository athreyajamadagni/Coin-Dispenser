Dear ma'am, This is Athreya KJ from 1st Year E section from the RR campus with SRN :PES1UG20EC041.
I just noticed that another team might have taken our project title before us ( Project title : To design and implement a play fair cipher), soo i had a few questions about how to go about selecting the new project title selection.
1) Do we select a new title and fill out the same google form as earlier or will another link be sent? 
2) Can we select a title other than ones mentioned in the list of project titles.
3) When is the deadline to select a new topic?
Thank you for your support, looking forward to your reply.
